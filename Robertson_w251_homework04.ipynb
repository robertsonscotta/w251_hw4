One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion).   \n","  \n","In 2019, Kaggle hosted their [second competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge#description) on this research. The challenge was to create a model that is capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. The competitions used a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.\n","\n","We shall be using this dataset to benchmark a number of ML models. While the focus of the current competition is to mitigate bias, we will not be using the metric used in the competition. Instead we will be focusing on a simpler metric [Area under the Curve (or AUC)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-forum/53782) which is suitable to unbalanced binary datasets. Also, we shall not consider different levels of Toxicity; we shall purely take anything marked over the 0.5 level in the measured toxicity range as toxic, and anything underneath as non-toxic. \n","\n","We have created a jupyter notbook with some of the tools to model this problem in Deep Learning, using Logistic regression and MLP. Your challenge will be to fill in the models and benchmark the AUC you achieve on these models.\n","\n","We shall be using the keras deep learning package. As you may know, this is an API into DL frameworks, but is most commonly backed by Tensorflow. [keras.io](keras.io) is a great source for documentation and examples on layers available andn functionality. \n","\n","**Have fun!!**\n","\n","\n","*Disclaimer: the dataset used contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6i5slfilTu-s"},"source":["### Set up packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9aeKmC0PTu-u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601314531391,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4219,"user":{"displayName":"Scott Robertson","photoUrl":"","userId":"12524398221645028604"}},"outputId":"1e03627b-7489-47f9-913d-64c556c1bd8c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":561}},"source":["# Unfortunately the latest Keras version has a bug with Sparse matrices and we need to downgrade. \n","!pip install tensorflow==1.14\n","!pip install keras==2.2.5\n","import os\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import keras\n","sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer \n","from sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n","from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score"],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: tensorflow==1.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (1.14.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: keras-applications>=1.0.6 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.0.8)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tensorflow-estimator<1.15.0rc0,>=1.14.0rc0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.14.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: wheel>=0.26 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (0.35.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: astor>=0.6.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (0.8.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: keras-preprocessing>=1.0.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: protobuf>=3.6.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (3.12.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: absl-py>=0.7.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (0.10.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: grpcio>=1.8.6 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.32.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: termcolor>=1.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: wrapt>=1.11.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.12.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: google-pasta>=0.1.6 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (0.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy<2.0,>=1.14.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.18.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.14.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: gast>=0.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (0.3.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.10.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorflow==1.14) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: h5py in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from keras-applications>=1.0.6->tensorflow==1.14) (2.10.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from protobuf>=3.6.1->tensorflow==1.14) (50.3.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: markdown>=2.6.8 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0->tensorflow==1.14) (3.2.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: werkzeug>=0.11.15 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0->tensorflow==1.14) (1.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata;
